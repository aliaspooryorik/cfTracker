init()

Sets up several internal variables required for operation.

getApplications()

Retrieves an array containing the names of all current applications. This can include expired applications that have yet to be garbage collected.

getApplicationKeys(applicationName)

Returns an array of keys from the named application scope.

getApplicationValue(applicationName, key)

    * CF8 Only 

Returns the value of the named application scope key, without changing the last accessed time. This is important since requesting this periodically would keep an application alive when it should have timed out.

getAppTimeAlive(applicationName)

Returns the number of milliseconds the application has existed for.

getAppLastAccess(applicationName)

Returns the number of milliseconds since the application was last accessed.

getAppIdleTimeout(applicationName)

Returns the number of milliseconds the application will expire after if not accessed.

isAppExpired(applicationName)

Returns Yes/No if the application has expired (IdleTimeout). This can indicate expired applications that have not been removed yet by ColdFusion's internal processes.

getAppIdlePercent(applicationName)

Returns a percentage value of time left to application expiry.

getSessions()

Returns an array of session ID's.

getSessionKeys(sessionId)

Returns an array of session scope keys for the given session ID.

getSessionValue(sessionId, key)

    * CF8 Only 

Returns the value of a session scope key without changing the last accessed time. This is important as accessing the value directly would keep the session alive even though the user would have been idle for the required time out period.

getSessionCount()

Number of sessions currently in existence. This can include expired sessions that have not been garbage collected. Note: Expired sessions don't appear to exist for longer than a minute at most.

getAppSessions(applicationName)

Same as getSessions() but limited to the named application.

getAppSessionCount(applicationName)

Same as getSessionCount() but limited to the named application.

getSessTimeAlive(sessionId)

Time in milliseconds since the session was created.

getSessLastAccessed(sessionId)

Time in milliseconds since the session was last accessed.

getSessIdleTimeout(sessionId)

Time in milliseconds the session has to remain inactive to be marked as expired.

isSessExpired(sessionId)

Is the session expired or not.

getSessIdlePercent(sessionId)

Percent of idle time to expiry.

getMemFree()

Free memory (MB) available out of the total allowed.

getMemAllocated()

Current memory (MB) allocated for usage out of the maximum limit.

getMemFreeAllocated()

Free memory (MB) available out of the current allocated amount.

getMemUsed()

Amount of memory (MB) currently in use.

getMemMax()

The maximum amount of memory (MB) allowed, related to the JVM setting in CFIDE administrator.

getMem()

Returns a structure containing the information from all the other memory related methods.
