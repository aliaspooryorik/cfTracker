ValidateThis QuickStart Guide (v 0.91)

1. Unzip the framework files, which are in the /ValidateThis folder, somewhere.
2. Create a Mapping that points to the framework files, or simply unzip them into your web root.
3. Copy the JavaScript files from /ValidateThis/client/jQuery/js/ into a folder than will be accessible by your web pages (e.g., /js/ off your web root).
4. Create an xml file for each of your Business Objects for which you want ValidateThis to generate validations.  Place all of them in the same folder.  Take a look at the sample xml file in /ServiceDemo/model/User.xml for an example.  There is also an XML Schema Definition available in /ValidateThis/core/validateThis.xsd.
5. To use the framework, create a ValidateThisConfig struct, and then instantiate the ValidateThis.cfc service object, passing in the struct, like so:

<cfset ValidateThisConfig = {JSRoot="/js/",definitionPath="/model/"} />
<cfset application.ValidateThis = createObject("component","ValidateThis.ValidateThis").init(ValidateThisConfig) />

Where JSRoot points to the folder into which you copied the required JS files, which you did in Step 3 above, and definitionPath points to the location of your ValidateThis xml files, which you created in Step 4 above.

You should now be able to utilize the framework by calling methods on application.ValidateThis.

Methods available include:

validate()
getRequiredFields()
getInitializationScript()
getValidationScript()

Please see the demo application in /ServiceDemo for examples of using these methods.
